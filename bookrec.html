    <h1>A Trilogy of Books</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/threebody.jpg" alt="Three Body Problem">
    <p>As someone who currently works in a library, I get a lot of chances to read all sorts of books during my downtime.
    A set of those books would be a trilogy by Liu, Cixin, "Remembrance of Earth's Past," also referred as
    "The Three Body Problem"</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.tor.com/2014/09/30/the-three-body-problem-silent-spring-excerpt-chapters-1-3/">Excerpt:</a>
      Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to
      establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to
      invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings
      and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion. The result is a science fiction
      masterpiece of enormous scope and vision.
    </p>
    <p>I would strongly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys sci-fi and exploring one of the many solutions
    to the Fermi Paradox.</p>

    <h2>What is the Fermi Paradox?</h2>
    <p>The Fermi Paradox explores the idea that there is such a high chance of extraterrestrial civilizations existing in
      the universe, and yet we have yet to actually come across hard evidence proving their existence. One of the solutions
      that the book uses as a plot point is the "Dark Forest" solution.
